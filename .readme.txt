## Setup

1. Clone the repo and place it in your local server root (e.g., `htdocs/` for XAMPP).
2. Create a MySQL database and import `event_booking` (provided in repo).
3. Configure DB credentials in `database/Database.php`.
4. Start your local server and hit endpoints via Postman.

## API Endpoints

- GET /events — List all events
- POST /events — Create an event
- PUT /events/{id} — Update an event
- DELETE /events/{id} — Delete an event
- POST /attendees — Register an attendee
- PUT /attendees/{id} — Update attendee
- DELETE /attendees/{id} — Delete attendee

## Auth Strategy (Not Implemented)

- **Events:** Protected by bearer token.
- **Attendees:** Open endpoint for registration.
- Token-based auth via middleware or route guard using JWT is suggested.
